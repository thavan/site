### 1.1 Introduction

Python is a general purpose programming language. First version of Python was released in 1991. Python syntax is inspired by C syntax, but it has much easier. If you are coming from other languages like C or Java, note that Python doesn't use curly braces in block of code like functions. Semicolon is also optional and generally people don't use that in Python. Python is majorly used in building web applications, business applications and also used in scientific research, data science and testing & automation.

### 1.2 Advantages

* You actually write less code comparing to other languages to accomplish similar task.
* There is a saying that you write a pseudo code and it is actually a Python program. Python avoids complex symbols when writing programs. Even though you can use semi colons, Python discourages the use of it.
* Python has a very larger community support. You are almost certainly going to get an answer when you post a question to stackoverflow.
* Python comes with a very extensive standard library which includes regex, maths, threads, os, network, standard internet protocols (http, ftp, smtp), email handling, xml processing and gui tools kits.
* Very large and popular third party libraries (django, flask, panda, numpy etc.)
