I was searching some games in Google Play store. Finding a game, you like within thousand of games, is toughest task. I install lots of game in my mobile and uninstall it within a hour. It gets bored in first play itself. Some games seems to be good but really lags in graphics.

Interestingly, I found this game. <b>Quell Reflect</b>. It is actually a puzzler game. Your task is to collect the pearls using water drops. Every level makes you think a lot. If you try a lot, you will complete the level. But completing the level within minimum number of moves by avoiding obstacles is the challenging part of this game.

* Excellent graphics - It has stunning background art styles.
* Mind relaxing background sound track.
* Over 80 levels.
* You get different achievements based your game play.
* You never get bored until you complete all the levels.

Quell Reflect is not a free game. But in my point of view, it is worth for the money you pay. The average rating for this game in the Google Play store is 4.8 out of 5, voted by around 9000 users. This rating is really high and above average.
