title: An Android app to search baby names
---

I have published a new Android app in Play Store called "Tamil Names". It allows you to browse through a huge collection of Tamil names. It also offers a good search functionality to search names containing specific letters.
I have categorized the names in to broader groups so that search and navigation could be easier to find a good name. It can be downloaded [here from Play Store][download_link]
