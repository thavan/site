Initially I was regularly using the stock music player. It had a complete revamp recently and then the development is going on the way more towards Google play music and subscriptions. It plays the local music files but no theme support or any UI customization options and the sound quality is horrible.
Then I tried PlayerPro. The main problem is app design. Even though it has all the features, they keep the old design. I'm the fan of new Holo design and it costs around $4.5 which is pretty high for a music app for me.
So I looked for some alternatives then found poweramp. No one can beat its equalizer effects, but the same problem, ugly UI.

Nowplaying music player was the enhanced version of cyanogenmod's Apollo music player. It supported lyrics search. I used it around two months. Sony filed a complaint against it for the lyrics search and Google removed it from play store. No more app updates and support. Then NexMusic player, same problem. Time to search for another app.

Then n7 music player. It has a intuitive design but not for my taste. It takes lot of time to scan media folders and ugly lock screen widget. It creates lots of sub folders in your music folders for album arts caching. I really hate when apps creates files or directories in my music directory. This happens also in playerpro and poweramp.

Then Shuttle+. It has simple UI and looked great. But its lags in features. It has no lyrics support. Tag editing and searching need improvement. No support for folder play.

I just expect a player with,
	* Simple nice Holo interface.
	* A minimal equalizer.
	* Embedded lyrics reading from tags.
	* Folder play.
	* Tag editing including album art.
	* Unified search.
	* stable.
