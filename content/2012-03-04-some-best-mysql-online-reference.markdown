I was preparing this list to my colleagues. I'm posting it here, so that someone will find it useful. 

* [http://code.google.com/edu/tools101/mysql.html]() - A good simple introduction from Google code university materials. It covers Introduction, setting up tables and basic queries.
* [http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/tutorial.html]() - Official Mysql tutorial site. The site looks ugly, but It covers all topics.
