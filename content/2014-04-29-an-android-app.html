<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">This week I published a new Android app in Play Store called "Tamil Names". It allows you to browse through a huge collection of Tamil names. It also offers a good search functionality to search names containing specific letters.<div><br /></div><div>I have categorized the names in to broader groups so that search and navigation could be easier to find a good name. It can be downloaded here from&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.thava.babynames" target="_blank">[Play Store]</a></div><div><br /></div><div>Since earlier Android 2.3 days, I wanted to do some development in Android, &nbsp;but never had time to do it as my primary development was focused on Python. Hopefully, I look forward to write few more apps for Android in future.</div></div><div class="blogger-post-footer">http://feeds.feedburner.com/thavatech</div>
