<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I frequently read Vikatan magazines online. I have subscribed to all magazines for a year. Somehow, I feel that the website is not better optimized for reading. There is no way to know that new articles are published in the website and also I find it difficult to keep track of the articles read. I tried to subscribe their rss feeds, so that I can get new articles delivered in feedly. But it tured out that their rss feed only delivers 12 articles per magazine not even a single sign of remaining articles.<div><br /></div><div>Their android mobile app is terrible and very hard to use. It just downloads the entire magazine in pdf format and shows it. Mobile users will know how hard it is to read pdf files in mobile screen. I'm not sure why do they provide such a bad way reading experience.</div><div><br /></div><div>At high level of frustration, I wrote a script to crawl each and every article of subscribed magazines from their website and getting it delivered in my email account. This way I will never miss any article. This art</div><div><br /></div><div>I have put this in GitHub and It can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/thavan/vikatan-crawler" target="_blank">here</a> [<a href="https://github.com/thavan/vikatan-crawler">https://github.com/thavan/vikatan-crawler</a>].</div></div>
