Static site generators are tools that generators static sites i.e. raw html files. It means web pages are served as html files as it is. There won't be any kind of data processing, session management or user authentication system. This means this static html files can be placed in server that serves html files. We don't need a webserver that supports php, jsp, database, django etc. All you need is a webserver that serves static files.

But ultimately, I'm fine with conventional blogging system, like blogger. Blogger supports custom domain. Setup a new blog and setup your custom domain, and you are ready to go with your new personal website. But configuring the blogger is somewhat tedious. Even though blogger provides extensive options to configure your blog's look and feel and layout, it always seems to be difficult to bring up a design up to my expectation. The other option is wordpress. In wordpress, to setup a custom domain, you have to pay for that, or you can host wordpress in your own website. I personally hate PHP. I don't want to take all the burder by installing and configuring LAMB stack in my server.

OK. How static site generators work?

* Write your posts in `markdown` or `rst`.
* Run the static site generator to parse these posts into html.
* Upload the generated output to any server that serves html (or even host it in github).

There are two main static site generators that really impresses me.

* [Jekyll][jekyll] - A static site generator written in Ruby.
* [Pelican][pelican] - A static site generator written in Python.

For me, both has their own pros and cons. Its up to you to choose any one of them. Both Pelican and Jekyll can be hosted in github pages.

Jekyll
======
Lets install Jekyll.

	:::bash
	wget http://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.1/ruby-2.1.4.tar.gz
	tar -zxvf ruby-2.1.4.tar.gz
	cd ruby-2.1.4/
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install
	wget http://production.cf.rubygems.org/rubygems/rubygems-2.4.2.tgz
	tar -zxvf rubygems-2.4.2.tgz
	cd rubygems-2.4.2/

	apt-get install rubygems
	gem install jekyll # wait here. this step will take little bit longer without any indication.

Now type `jekyll new` to configure a new jekyll site.

Jekyll creates following three main folders.

* `_drafts`: Place all drafts here. Once they are complete, move them to `_posts` directory.
* `_posts`: Place all published and ready to publish posts here.
* `_site`: jekyll will generate the site in this directory. This can be hosted to your webserver.

I'm not going to explain how to write posts in markdown format. This post written in markdown format. Source can be found [here][post-source].
Run `jekyll build` to build the posts and `jekyll serve` to preview them in local machine.

Publishing
==========
If we want publish it in our own server, its going to be very easy. Just copy the folder _site in your webserver and you are good to go.
Publishing in github pages, requires some further steps.

* Assuming you have a github account, create a repository with the name username.github.io. Put your github username in the username part.
* In your jekyll project directory, init the git repository.

		:::bash
		git init #Add the newly created repo as new remote origin.
		git remote add origin <github project url> # add the newly created repo as remote origin
		git add <directories> <files> # add all files.
		git commit -m "Initial commit" # commit everything.
		git push origin master # push to server.

* Now wait for another twenty minutes, then your site will be up in http://username.github.io

Pelican
=======

Pelican on the other hand is purely written in Python. If you are a Python fan, you have to try this first, because it will be easier to debug and change the code as you already knew python. Installing is very easy. Use pip.

	:::bash
	pip install pelican

If you want to use markdown syntax, then install markdown

	:::bash
	pip install markdown
	
By running ``pelican-quickstart``, we can create a new pelican site from scratch. Pelican also allows you to write post using `RST` format. When running the ``pelican-quickstart`` command, you will be asked if you want to create a make for the site. Click yes, and you'll get lots of handy shortcuts to important functions like ``make html`` will generate the htmls in output directory, ``make serve`` will start a development server in localhost so that we can preview the website.

Migrating from other blogging platforms
---------------------------------------
Migrating from other blogs is pain when come of them. Eventhough there are lots tools availabel today, you'll have to manually make minor edits in all your previous posts. I used blogger before. After few attempts to import them in static site generator, I decided to leave the earlier posts blogger itself because they were not worthy to spend time to import them from blogger to static site. Jekyll has built-in support for importing posts from wordpress and few other networks. To import from blogger, you'll have to export them into xml in blogger dashboard, and import them in Jekyll or Pelican. There is no direct import option for blogger.

Importing is going to cause some pain, but it is worth a try.

Pelican Themes
--------------
There is a github repository, that accumulates all pelican themes in one repo. clone [this][theme-repo] repository from github and you'll be able to use theme by adding the theme directory in pelican settings file.

	:::bash
	git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes.git
	
open pelican and add the following line.

	:::python
	THEME = "/home/user/pelican-themes/theme-name" # this should be path of downloaded theme.
	
Conclusion
----------
Considering the fact of freedom to have your content on your hand and the freedom to host it anywhere, Static site generator seems to be a good option. No fancy widgets, no custom javascript codes, no commenting system. Put everything in an organized file structure, write posts in markdown and publish it. Publish whatever file types you want.
