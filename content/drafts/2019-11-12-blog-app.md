## Creating new app
In this post we will write a simple blog app to understand the basic concepts of Django. Let’s use the project we have 
created already in the previous post.

```bash
➜ workon mysite
➜ cd workspace/mysite                           
➜ python manage.py startapp blog 
```    

Now you will see a new directory named `blog` in our project folder with following directory structure.

```bash
~/workspace/mysite
.
├── blog
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── migrations
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py
├── manage.py
└── mysite
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py
```

## Django project structure
As we go along developing our blog app let's get familiar with some of Django terms.

### settings.py
When we create a app, first thing we need to do is to tell Django that we have created this app. Open `mysite/settings.py`
and look for INSTALLED_APPS variable. There are already 6 apps added to this list. These are built-in apps that provide 
different functionality to our Django powered website. We will learn more about those later. For now let’s add our blog
app to INSTALLED_APPS variable.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    
    'blog.apps.BlogConfig'
]
```

### models.py
What is models? To understand it in simple terms let’s see an example. Let’s say you we designing a website for a 
icecream store. What kind of objects we do have in our icecream store? Icecream object. Customer object, Shopping Cart 
object. We call these catogories as Models. Each model specifies the properties of a object.

In Python term, each model is a class. Class variables are properties of the that model.

In our blog app, Author is a model, blog post is a model. Let’s create our first model in open blog/models.py.
```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.utils import timezone


class Post(models.Model):
    DRAFT = 'draft'
    PUBLISHED = 'published'
    POST_STATUS_CHOICES = (
        (DRAFT, 'Draft'),
        (PUBLISHED, 'Published'),
    )
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    published_time = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
    created_time = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_time = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=POST_STATUS_CHOICES, default=DRAFT)
    body = models.TextField()
```
A model definition is a class in Django. In the above code, we created `Post` class to represent the post
model. A model can have multiple attributes. In `Post` model title, author are attributes. You can relate a 
model to a database table. An instance of a model can be related to a specific row of that table. All fields
in a model are columns of that table. In the background, this is what Django does. It creates a table for 
every model. When you create a new object for that model, Django actually creates a new row in the table.

While working with Django, most of the time, you don't need to directly interact with database. Django provides
a abstraction layer between model and table. We interact with models as regular Python classes and Django 
translates your model changes into underlying table. So the data is persistently stored in the database.

Django does not automatically create tables for us. We need to create them by calling management commands.
Lets create tables for blog model.

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Admin interface
The output will be something like below saying migrations are successful. It means tables are created in the database.
As we use default sqlite database we don't need to create and databases or username passwords.

When we create a blog site obviously you want to create a admin interface for editors to add or edit posts. Let's do
that first. Open `blog/admin.py` and add our `Post` model in it.

```python
from .models import Post
admin.site.register(Post)
```

Now let's run a local development server to see our changes.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/])(http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) in browser. Ah, we don't have a username and password
created for admin. Let's create one.
```bash
python manager.py createsuperuser
```

Login with the newly created username and password and you can see our `Post` model added to admin site. 
![Django Admin](/assets/images/django/admin_site.png)

Click on Posts link. This will take you the page where you can see all you blog posts. Right now we don't have posts.
Let's add a post by clicking ADD POST link. After filling the fields Click on save button. List of posts now have one 
post which is listed as `Post object(1)`. It says it is a post object. It will useful if it can display post title
instead of saying it `object`. Let's take Python's `__str__` function to achive that. Open `blog/models.py` and add
`__str__` function to `Post` model.

```python
body = models.TextField()

def __str__(self):
    return self.title
```

Now if you refresh the page, we can see post title in the list of posts instead of object names. Now that we are done
with admin interface. Let's build a simple UI to show our posts to public users in next post.
