I'm a fan of SLBC (Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation) Tamil national service radio. They provide an online streaming service.

Its very easy to listen SLBC tamil national service via mplayer.
If you use ubuntu, type the following commands in console.

    :::bash
    sudo apt-get install mplayer
    mplayer http://220.247.227.4/live

In other OS, install mplayer from [source][source_link]
