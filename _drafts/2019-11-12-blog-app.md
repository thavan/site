In this post we will see how to write a simple blog app. Let’s use the project we have created already in the previous post.
```bash
➜ workon mysite
➜ cd workspace/mysite                           
➜ python manage.py startapp blog
➜ tree 
```    

Now you will see a new directory named `blog` in our project folder with following directory structure.
```bash
~/workspace/mysite via mysite 
.
├── blog
│   ├── admin.py
│   ├── apps.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── migrations
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py
│   ├── tests.py
│   └── views.py
├── manage.py
└── mysite
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py
```
When we create a app, first thing we need to do is to tell Django that we have created this app. Open mysite/settings.py and look for INSTALLED_APPS variable. There are already 6 apps added to this list. These are built-in apps that provide different functionalities to our Django powered website. We will learn about those later. For now let’s add our blog app to INSTALLED_APPS variable.

Now let’s look at few files in blog folder.
1. models.pyPermalink

What is models? To understand it in simple terms let’s see an example. Let’s say you we designing a website for a icecream store. What kind of objects we do have in our icecream store? Icecream object. Customer object, Shopping Cart object. We call these catogories as Models. Each model specifies the properties of a object.

In Python term, each model is a class. Class variables are properties of the that model.

In our blog app, Author is a model, blog post is a model. Let’s create our first model in open blog/models.py.
```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.utils import timezone


class Post(models.Model):
    DRAFT = 'draft'
    PUBLISHED = 'published'
    POST_STATUS_CHOICES = (
        (DRAFT, 'Draft'),
        (PUBLISHED, 'Published'),
    )
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=200)
    author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    published_time = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)
    created_time = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_time = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=POST_STATUS_CHOICES, default=DRAFT)
    body = models.TextField()
```
