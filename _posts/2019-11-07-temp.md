## Introduction
Python's CGI library is good enough for writing websites from the ground. But we need to put a lot of effort into it 
to build a usable and secure website. When building a web application we often come across some common tasks like
authenticating users, connecting to a database, sending emails to users, a reliable admin interface to manage and add 
content to our site, etc. If we solve all of these problems ourselves, it is time-consuming. That's were Django comes 
into play. All common tasks in building a web application have been put into a Python package and it is called 
`Django web framework`.

Django was initially built for a news publishing website. News publishing environments often require rapid
development and release cycles. Sometimes you need to build new features and do an overnight deployment. It needs a 
robust admin interface to publish new articles quickly. Django helps us to do all of these tasks effectively and
rapidly. Django is sometimes referred as "Batteries are included". It means whatever common tasks you will need to do 
when building a typical website, it is already solved in Django. All we need to do is figuring out what are all the
APIs are available and learning about how to use them effectively.

**Note:** If you want to try a lightweight framework, take a look at the Flask framework.

## Installing Django
Installing Django is straight forward. `pip install django` will install the latest Django version. If you want to install 
a specific version you can do `pip install django==2.1`. In this case, Django version 2.1 will be installed. To check if 
it is correctly installed open python shell and import Django.

```bash
mkvirtualenv djbook --python=python3
pip install django
```
**Tip:** In the above commands I have used `mkvirtualenv` command to create a new virtual environment. It comes with the Python 
package [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It is a very convenient tool to create 
and mange Python virtual environments. Take a look at it if you are interested.

And then in Python shell,
```bash
>>> import django
>>> django.__version__
'2.2.7'
```

## Creating First Django Project
Now we are ready to build our first website. Django comes with a script called `django-admin`. We can use this
script to create new projects. Let's create a new project.

```bash
django-admin startproject mysite
cd mysite
```

In the mysite directory, you will see the following file structure. Don't worry about what to do with these files now.
We will learn this in later chapters.
```bash
mysite
├── manage.py
└── mysite
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── settings.py
    ├── urls.py
    └── wsgi.py

1 directory, 5 files
```
Now let's run a development server locally to see our website.
```zsh
python manage.py runserver
```
And the output will be the one like below. It is showing in which URL we can access our website. Our development server
is running in localhost and listening to the port 8000.
```bash
November 06, 2019 - 19:58:29
Django version 2.2.7, using settings 'mysite.settings'
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```
Now let's open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in a browser. We can see our website is up and running. Whatever shown on that
page is Django's default page. We will override it and put our content later.

That is all about it for now. We will do some real development in the next post.
